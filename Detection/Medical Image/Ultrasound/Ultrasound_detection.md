超声相较于MRI和CT的优势

> Over the decades, it has been demonstrated that US has several major advantages over other medical imaging modalities such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT), including its non-ionizing radiation, portability, accessibility, and cost effectiveness.

深度学习在超声分析中的应用

> As noted earlier, current applications of deep learning techniques in US analysis mainly involve three types of tasks: classification, detection, and segmentation for various anatomical structures or tissues, such as the breast, prostate, liver, heart, and fetus.
